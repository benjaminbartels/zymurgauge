# SPI

This package provides drivers for [spi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus) devices. It currently must be used along with the [raspberry pi](https://gobot.io/documentation/platforms/raspi) adaptor that supports the needed interfaces for spi devices. This uses the experimental [spi package](https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/io/spi) which only works on linux systems.

## Getting Started

## Installing
```
go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/...
```
